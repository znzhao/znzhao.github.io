This paper provides direct causal evidence that sentiment shocks induced from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements can affect stock market returns through social media channels. By using historical Twitter data surrounding FOMC announcements, I combine machine learning and lexical methods to measure the sentiment changes induced by these announcements. By comparing the differences between stocks with high and low exposure to Twitter (measured by the number of tweets posted about a specific stock in the past week), I demonstrate that stocks with higher Twitter exposure are more affected by sentiment shocks, providing evidence for the existence of a social media transmission channel. Price Stickiness, Capital Adjustment, and Monetary Policy Shocks (2021) Draft download: here Abstract: What is the cost of the price stickiness in terms of real variables? In this paper, I show with industrial-level and firm-level price stickiness data that the heterogeneity in the price stickiness leads to the different responses of a firm\u2019s capital adjustment and other real variables to an exogenous monetary policy shock. In response to a contractionary MP shock, the investments of the firms with stickier prices drop more. This result is in line with a traditional multi-sector new Keynesian model with investment. The firms with stickier prices cannot react in price as much as the others to the contractionary MP shock, and a higher relative price leads to lower demand. With lower demand, the capital and labor inputs are both affected more, resulting in heterogeneous responses.","title":"Research"}]}
